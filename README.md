### Description

Reflection is an [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) plugin that reads [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files exported from FModel [(UEParse)](https://github.com/FabianFG/CUE4Parse), and **rebuilds them as real assets** in your project: materials, data tables, physics assets, and more. Connect it to a [Cloud](#cloud) instance to **fetch references automatically**, **reflect extra data** onto assets you've already imported, and *validate* your project against the game files.

✨ [Contributors](#contribute)

### Example Use

* Importing **materials**, data assets, and data tables — [see more](#asset-types)
* Porting **physics assets** for skeletal meshes
* Porting **sound effects** to Unreal Engine
* Automating asset porting workflows

This project aims to streamline the porting and modding experience, making it easier to bring game assets into Unreal Engine.

### Licensing

Reflection is licensed under the MIT License. Read more in the [LICENSE](https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/Reflection/blob/main/LICENSE) file. The plugin also uses [Detex](https://github.com/hglm/detex) and [NVIDIA Texture Tools](https://docs.nvidia.com/texture-tools/index.html).

## Asset Types
If an asset type isn't listed below, **it's not currently supported by the plugin**.

|  | Asset Types |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🟢 **Curve** | CurveFloat, CurveVector, CurveLinearColor, CurveLinearColorAtlas |
| 🟣 **Data** | DataAsset, SlateBrushAsset, SlateWidgetStyleAsset, LandscapeLayerInfoObject, HLODProxy, AnimBoneCompressionSettings, AnimCurveCompressionSettings, UserDefinedEnum, UserDefinedStruct |
| 🔵 **Table** | CurveTable, DataTable, MirrorDataTable, StringTable |
| 🟠 **Material** | Material, MaterialFunction, MaterialInstanceConstant, MaterialParameterCollection, SubsurfaceProfile |
| 🟧 **Texture** | TextureRenderTarget2D, RuntimeVirtualTexture, PaperSprite |
| 🟡 **Sound** | SoundCue and most other sound classes are supported. SoundWave is fetched by a [Cloud Server](#cloud)! |
| 🔴 **Animation** | PoseAsset, Skeleton, SkeletalMeshLODSettings, BlendSpace, BlendSpace1D, AimOffsetBlendSpace, AimOffsetBlendSpace1D |
| ⚪ **Physics** | PhysicsAsset, PhysicalMaterial |
| 🟤 **Sequencer** | CameraAnim, ForceFeedbackEffect |
| ✨ **Effects** | ParticleSystem |
| 🟩 **Landscape** | LandscapeGrassType, FoliageType_InstancedStaticMesh, FoliageType_Actor |
| 🔤 **UI** | Font |

#### The following asset types add onto a pre-existing asset
|  | Asset Types |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **🔴 Animation** | AnimSequence, AnimMontage **(Animation Curves)** |

#### Partial Blueprint Importing (Experimental)
If the parent class exists, it'll import the components and defaults of the blueprint (Blueprints, Widget Blueprints, and Animation Blueprints). Enable **Enable Experiments** in Plugin Settings to use it.

<a name="material-data-prerequisites"></a>
#### 🟠 Material Data Prerequisites
Unreal Engine games made below 4.12 (a guess) will have material data. *Games made above that version will most definitely not have any material data*, and therefore the actual data will be stripped and cannot be imported. **Unless you are using a User Generated Content editor**, then it's possible material data will be there.

#### 🟣 C++ Classes Prerequisites
If your game uses custom C++ classes or structures, **you need to define them**.

See [Unreal Engine Modding Projects](https://github.com/Buckminsterfullerene02/UE-Modding-Tools?tab=readme-ov-file#game-specific-template-projects) for game-specific template projects.

## Installation
[<img align="left" width="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8e4f9c9-1268-4aee-ab1a-dabee31b3069?raw=true">](https://fmodel.app)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you haven't already, **install [FModel](https://fmodel.app) and set it up correctly, then proceed with the setup**.
>
>
> ​There is a specific FModel version for **material data support** found in the discord server.            
> [**Material Data Prerequisites still apply.**](#material-data-prerequisites)

We strongly recommend using the latest **commit** of Reflection to ensure compatibility with recent Unreal updates and access to the newest features.

Follow these steps to install **Reflection**:

1. **Download Reflection:**   
   There are two ways you can download Reflection. You can either stay up-to-date with the latest development changes (recommended if you want the newest features and fixes, but may occasionally require manual fixing), or download stable releases.

   1. **Up-to-date (Git Submodule)**   
      Open a terminal in your Unreal project root (where your `.uproject` file is located), then run:

      ```sh
      git submodule add https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/Reflection.git Plugins/Reflection
      git submodule update --init --recursive
      ```

   2. **Stable Releases (Manual Download)**   
      Go to the [Releases page](/../../releases) for the plugin.
      Download the **Source code (zip)**, extract it into your project's `Plugins` folder (create it if it doesn't exist), so the final path looks like:

      ```
      Project/Plugins/Reflection/
      ```
3. **Compile:**   
   Follow [**this tutorial**](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/qz93/unreal-engine-building-plugins) to build the plugin for your Unreal Engine version.
4. **Launch Your Project:**   
   Open your Unreal Engine project.

<details>
  <summary>Compile step failing on <b>Unreal Engine 4</b>? (<b>UnrealBuildTool.exe</b> not found)</summary>
  <br>

Some UE4 builds may fail to locate **UnrealBuildTool.exe** due to missing platform path definitions. You can fix this by manually adding a `PlatformPaths` entry to `BaseEngine.ini`.

#### Steps

1. Go to your Unreal Engine install directory:
   ```
   UE_[VERSION]/Engine/Config/
   ```
2. Open:
   ```
   BaseEngine.ini
   ```
3. Scroll to the very bottom of the file and add:
   ```ini
   [PlatformPaths]
   UnrealBuildTool=Engine/Binaries/DotNet/UnrealBuildTool.exe
   ```
4. Save the file.

### Set up the Cloud ✨
**Enable Cloud** in Plugin Settings, then [set up a Cloud instance](https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/Core/releases) and start it.

Once running, Reflection **fetches references automatically** instead of asking you for each one, and a **Cloud Tools** menu lets you reflect extra data (collision, animation curves, sockets, fonts, and more) onto assets you've already imported. **Validation** compares your project against the game files to catch anything missing or misplaced.

<a name="workflow"></a>
## Workflow

1. Find an asset in [FModel](https://fmodel.app), and save it by right-clicking and pressing `Save Properties`. Locate the file on your computer and copy the location.

2. Press the [Reflection](https://github.com/JsonAsAsset/Reflection) button on your content browser, and a file picker should pop up. <img align="right" width="330" src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/020d005d-f34b-4bb0-b3d2-c1c4c570eb42>

3. Select the file and press Open.

4. The asset **imports** and brings you to the created asset in the content browser once it's done.

Need a whole folder at once instead? Use **Reflect Folder of JSON Files**, under the Reflection dropdown's Asset Tools.
